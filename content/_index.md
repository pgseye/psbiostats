<p>Biostatistician and Data Analyst. Accidental coffeesnob and home roaster.</p>
<p>I originally graduated as an Optometrist over 20 years ago. After practising for several years I became interested in eye research, completing a PhD investigating morphological variation of the optic nerve head and the association with ageing diseases such as glaucoma. I discovered that I enjoyed statistical programming and data analysis/visualisation, subsequently undertaking a Masters of Biostatistics while working as a Research Fellow in Ophthalmology. I have now moved into data analytics full-time and am available to help with your medical research and/or data science needs.</p>
<p>I endeavour to improve my statistical programming and data science skills daily with <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">DataCamp</a>.</p>
<p>This website was written in <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> using the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-resume/">Resume</a> theme for  <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>.</p>
